## Overview

Welcome to the **[CodingFantasy](http://codingfantasy.com/games/mcp) MCP Challenge**! This repo contains a series of increasingly complex coding challenges that teach you the fundamentals of Model Context Protocol (MCP) - the standardized way for AI applications to interact with data sources and tools.

## Technical Learning Path

Through the 5 progressive acts, you'll master key MCP capabilities:

### Act 1: "The Onboarding From Hell" - MCP Client Connection
- Setting up the MCP SDK
- Creating a basic client
- Establishing connection with a server
- Handling requests and responses

### Act 2: "Resources Under Pressure" - MCP Resources
- Implementing the Resources capability
- Creating and exposing data to clients
- Handling resource updates and subscriptions
- Building robust error handling

### Act 3: "Prompt Engineering" - MCP Prompts
- Implementing the Prompts capability
- Creating standardized prompt templates
- Handling dynamic arguments
- Building multi-step interactions

### Act 4: "Tools of the Trade" - MCP Tools
- Implementing the Tools capability
- Creating executable functions
- Handling validation and error cases
- Building sophisticated tool implementations

### Act 5: "The Demo" - Full System Integration
- Combining all capabilities
- Creating a production-ready demo
- Connecting to Claude or other LLMs
